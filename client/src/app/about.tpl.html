                <p>We are a local real estate investment company with a spirit of teamwork and caring.

For the past few years, our team has been helping homeowners navigate difficult circumstances by providing real estate solutions.

                <p>We are excited to announce our first ever cash incentive program, where YOU can be part of our mission!

This program is designed specifically for community members to be rewarded for taking an active approach in helping their neighbors and their community.

Many people want or need to sell their home, but do not realize all of their options. With the help of friends like you, we can provide solutions for more and more people.

We pay you just to let us know about available houses!</p>

            <h1>How It Works</h1>
        </div>
        <p class="lead">The process is simple. Do you have a friend or family member who is behind in payments or needs to sell right away? Is there a vacant, distressed or neglected house on your block?

Simply contact us with the information, then we'll pay you $$$ if we decide to move forward in buying the property.

We're looking to buy four to eight properties per month . so this is an incredible opportunity for you to make some SERIOUS cash!

This is a perfect opportunity for part-time or weekend work, and if you're interested in learning real estate investing there is no better way to start. In fact, many full-time investors started out referring properties in programs just like this!</p>
